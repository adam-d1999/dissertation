        <h2>Anfield VIP Area</h2>
        <p>We are proud to have had the opportunity to help design a bespoke hybrid GRP system for the VIP area in Liverpool Football Clubs new main stand; Kenny Dalglish Stand. As a company we were privileged to be a part of the renovations of Anfield, a stadium of so much history.</p>
        <p>The project was under major time constraints due to the system having to be installed in the off-season, giving us only three months to complete the project. A project on this scale had not been attempted before, but we were confident that it would be completed in time for the new season.</p>
    
        <img src="images/anfield-three.jpg">
        <div class="case-studies">
        <p>It began with the movement and installation of a modular steel framework as a structural base to place our bespoke anti-slip GRP sheets and treads onto. Once the GRP Sheets and Treads were secure, the stadia seats could then be installed into the modular GRP system.</p>
        <p>We then carried out slip tests on-site to guarantee that our surfaces would comply with British regulations. The project was completed within 3 months ready for the season to kick off.</p>
