        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the guidance path surface tactile is used to guide visually impaired people along a route when the traditional cues, such as a property line or kerb edge are not available. It can also be used to guide people around obstacles, for example street furniture in a pedestrianised area. The surface has been designed so that people can be guided along the route either by walking on the tactile surface or by maintaining contact with a long cane.</p>
        <h2>Specification</h2>
        <p>The profile of the guidance path surface tactile comprises a series of raised, flat-topped bars running in the direction of pedestrian travel. The bars are 5.5mm (±0.5mm) high, 35mm wide and are spaced 45mm apart. Thickness 5mm.</p>
        <h2>Benefits</h2>

        <p>No Landfill Costs</p>
        <p>No Heavy Machinery Needed</p>
        <p>Easy to Install</p>
        <p>5 Times Harder Wearing than Traditional Methods</p>
        <p>Manufactured from Sustainable Resources</p>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Where the traditional guidance given by a standard foot-way between the property line and carriageway does not exist</p>
        <p>Where pedestrians need to be guided around obstacles</p>
        <p>Where a number of visually impaired people need to find a specific location</p>
        <p>In transport terminals to guide people between facilities.</p>
