        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the Blister Surface Tactile is to provide a warning to visually impaired people who would otherwise find it difficult to notice the difference between where the footpath ends and the road begins. The surface is an essential safety feature for this group of road users at pedestrian crossing areas.</p>
        <p>Created to aid visually impaired and blind pedestrians when navigating towns and cities. The blister surface tactile makes it easier for individuals to identify where drop kerbs and road crossings are located.</p>
        <p>The blister pattern can be felt under foot, which allows pedestrians with limited sight to access extra information about their surroundings. The contrasting colour of the blister tactiles also helps to provide individuals with information regarding road crossing locations.</p>
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Where the foot-way has been dropped flush with the carriageway.</p>
        <p>Where the carriageway has been raised to the level of the foot-way.</p>
